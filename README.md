# AI Training Recommendations

In this document, you will find a curated list of training courses and resources aimed at helping individuals become more familiar and comfortable with AI concepts. This list is designed to provide a progressive learning path, starting with general knowledge and moving towards more advanced topics. Whether you are just beginning your AI journey or looking to deepen your understanding, these resources will guide you through various aspects of AI, from basic concepts to advanced applications.

This list is by no means comprehensive. If you find something compelling that you think should be added here, feel free to submit a PR.

I did not create any of these resources. For specific questions about each one, please refer to their contact pages.
